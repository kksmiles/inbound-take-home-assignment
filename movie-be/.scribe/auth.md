# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_AUTH_KEY}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

First call the <b>Login</b> endpoint to obtain a token. Then paste it here in the format <code>Bearer your-token-here</code> to use the Try It Out feature.
